      <p>
        I'm a fullstack developer with a healthcare background based in New York.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm passionate about combining my experience in healthcare and knowledge of web development to work on projects that improve people's lives.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to keeping up with current web development trends,  I also enjoy hiking, reading fantasy and sci-fi novels, knitting and crochet.

        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Express.js</li>
